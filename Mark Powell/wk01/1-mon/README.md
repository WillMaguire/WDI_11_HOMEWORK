Redux is a predictale state container for JavaScript apps.
(if you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework.](www.redux.com) )

it helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments(client, server. native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience , such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](www.google.com)    

You can use Redux together with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html), or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

#### Developer Experience
I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](www.google.com). My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
