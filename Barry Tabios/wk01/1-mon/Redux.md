###### Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
###### (if you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Frame](https://reduxframework.com))

###### It helps you write application that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and
###### are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a developer experience, such as [live code editing comibined with a](google.com.au)
###### [time travelling debugger.](google.com.au)

###### You can use Redux together with [React](https://reduxframework.com/), or with any other view library.
###### It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

### Developer Experience

###### I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called ["Hot Reloading with Time Travel".](google.com.au)My goal was to create
###### a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement
###### logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
