Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.  
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework.](https://reduxframework.com/))  

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and  
are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a  
time traveling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).  

You can use Redux together with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), or with any other view library.  
It is tiny (2kb, including dependencies).

### Testimonials  
>["Love what you're doing with Redux"](https://twitter.com/jingc/status/616608251463909376)  
Jing Chen, Creator of Flux

>[“I asked for comments on Redux in FB's internal JS discussion group, and it was universally praised. Really  
 awesome work.”](https://twitter.com/fisherwebdev/status/616286955693682688)  
Bill Fisher, Author of Flux documentation

> [“It's cool that you are inventing a better Flux by not doing Flux at all.”](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz/status/616271392930201604)  
André Staltz, creator of Cycle  

### Developer Experience  
I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called []“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). My goal was to create  
 a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement  
  logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
