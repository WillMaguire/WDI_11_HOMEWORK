Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework](www.google.com).)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environment (client, server, and native), and
are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a
time travelling debugger](www.google.com).

You can use Redux together with [React](www.google.com), or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

###Developer Experience###
I wrote Redux while wokring on my React Europe talk called ["Hot Reloading with Time Travel"](www.google.com). My goal was to create a state management
library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel,
universal apps, record and play, without any buy-in from the developer.
