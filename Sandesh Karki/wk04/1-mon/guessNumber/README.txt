Title: Guess The Number

Activity:

You are to generate a basic "guess my number" game. The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10. The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.
Specification:

The user should be asked to guess a number
If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.
Extensions:

Let the user choose the maximum value (so they can play a long game with a random value between 0 and 10000, for example).
Give feedback to the user: "Wrong, guess higher!" or "Wrong, guess lower!"
