Redux is a predicatable state container for JavaScript apps.
(if you're looking for a wordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework](https://www.google.com).)

I helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments
(client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great
developer experience, such as [live code editiing combined with a time traveling
gebugger](https://www.google.com).

You can use REdux together with [React](https://www.google.com), or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

**Developer Experience**

I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called ["Hot Reloading with
Time Travel"](https://www.google.com). My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but
comp;etely predicatble behavior, so it is possible to implement
logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buyin from the developer.
