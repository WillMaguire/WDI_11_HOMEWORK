==========
Redux is a predictable state container for Javascript apps.  
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux framework](#).)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](#).

You can use Redux together with [React](#), or with any other view library.  
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

### Developer Experience
I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called ["Hot Reloading with Time Travel"](#). My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
