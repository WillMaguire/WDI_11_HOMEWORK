// Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

for (var numb = 0; numb < 20; numb++) {
  if (numb % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(numb + ' this number is even');
  }
  else {
    console.log(numb + ' Number is odd');
  }
