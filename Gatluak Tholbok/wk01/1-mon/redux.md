<p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (if you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out <a href="#">Redux Framework.)</a></p>

<p>It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (clients, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer <br />
+experience, such as <a href="#">live code editing combined with a time travelling debugger.</a></p>

<p>You can use Redux together with <a href="#">React</a>, or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).</p>

<p>New! learn Reduc from its creator:

<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<a href='#'>"Love what you're doing eith Redux"</a>
<p>Jing Chen, creator of Flux</p>

<a href="#">"I asked for comments on Redux in FB's internal JS discussion group, and it was universally praised. Really awesome work."</a>
<p>Bill Fisher, author of Flux documentation</p>

<h4>Developer Experience</h4>

<p>I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called <a href='#'>"Hot Reloading with Time Travel".</a> My goal wass to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.</p>
