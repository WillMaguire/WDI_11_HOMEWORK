* Create a sinatra web application to be able to create a product.
* The product should have a `name`, `price` & `is_stocked` which is `true` if the product is available, and `false` if it is not.
* You should have the following views:
   * An index page to show ONLY the products that are in stock (where `is_stocked` is `true`)
   * A show page for each product
   * An edit page to modify the product
* You should be able to create, edit and delete products.
* Create a database in postgresql to store your `products` table.
* Use ActiveRecord to talk to the database.
