The japanese lover:
In 1939, as Poland falls under the shadow of the Nazis, young Alma Belasco's
parents send her away to live in safety with an aunt and uncle in their opulent
mansion in San Francisco. There, as the rest of the world goes to war, she
encounters Ichimei Fukuda, the quiet and gentle son of the family's Japanese
gardener.
