# Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for Javascript apps.
(if you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework] (http://www.google.com).

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great
developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](http://www.google.com).

You can use Redux together with [React] (http://www.google.com), or with any other view library. <br/>
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

## Developer experience

I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called "Hot Reloading with time travel".  My Goal was to create a state management library with minimal API by completely predictable behaviours, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
